extractor/pdf.py
================
Handles low-level PDF reading.

Two strategies:
  1. Text-based  – uses pdfplumber (fast, accurate for ATS / digital resumes).
  2. OCR-based   – converts pages to images via pdf2image then runs Tesseract
                   (slower, needed for scanned / Canva-style resumes).

The public entry-point `extract_pdf` automatically decides which strategy to
use based on how well the text-based extraction performs.
